# decentify-app
##### 

With the increasing popularity of crowdfunding in India, fake fundraising campaigns have become a major problem, tarnishing the growth of this concept. To address this issue, I have developed a decentralized solution. This solution allows contributors to have complete visibility into how their funds are being utilized and even gives them control over their investment. The decentralized nature of the solution ensures transparency and accountability, mitigating the risk of fraud and misrepresentation.
